# Flags in Clouds

## Purpose of the Website:
The **Flags in Clouds** website is designed to provide an entertaining and educational experience focused on learning about world flags. The site serves two main functions:
1. **Flag Generation Feature** – Users can generate random flags of all the nations in our planet, helping them visually familiarize themselves with different country flags.
2. **Interactive Quiz** – A quiz challenges users to identify flags correctly, there will be a limited time to answer each question and reinforce their knowledge through an engaging gameplay format.

Although the website was intentionally designed for children at the age of primary school by combining an appealing bright colors and interactive learning approach, this website will make sure to make flag recognition enjoyable for users of all ages.

## User Story:
